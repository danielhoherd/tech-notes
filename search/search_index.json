This is useful when dealing with files from various sources that don't all use the same tag to store the original media creation time. By using TestName instead of FileName as the target, we observe what would occur, essentially a dry-run, instead of actually renaming the files. There is a funky behavior of %-c when you operate on a file that should ideally not be renamed. Exiftool will toggle back and forth each run appending and removing -1 . This assumes GNU xargs for the -r flag. #!/usr/bin/env bash set -x # The last valid variable from this list is used as the filename source create_date_sources=( TrackCreateDate RIFF:DateTimeOriginal MediaCreateDate FileModifyDate DateTimeOriginal CreateDate ) for opt in \"${create_date_sources[@]}\" ; do args+=( \"-TestName<${opt}\" ) ; done ; args+=( '-d' './%Y/%m/%Y%m%d-%H-%M-%S%%-c.%%le' ) find . -maxdepth 1 -type f ! -name '*.sh' -print0 | xargs -0 -r exiftool \"${args[@]}\" Rename music files in a directory There is a big gotcha here, which is that slashes will create directories where they appear, which can cause serious problems. The ${Tag;s/\\//_/} syntax replaces / with _ , but there may be other characters that can cause unexpected results. This is a great place to use -TestName to inspect what would change before using -FileName to make the changes. exiftool \\ '-FileName<${Artist;s/\\//_/} - ${Title;s/\\//_/}.%e' \\ '-FileName<${Artist;s/\\//_/} - ${Album;s/\\//_/} - ${Title;s/\\//_/}.%e' \\ *.mp3 *.m4a Move short videos to one dir, long videos to another dir In iOS, if you have Live Photo enabled it creates little movies each time you take a photo.

They allow you to work on distinct changes without mixing them all up together. Create a branch git checkout -b readme-fix Check which branch you're in git branch Rename (move) a branch git branch -m oldname newname git merge This lets you merge two branches. Merge branch with master git checkout master git merge readme-fix-branch git branch -d readme-fix-branch disable fast-forward merges You can control how the history is kept when merging. By default, fast-forward merges occur, which replays the commits on the branch that is being merged into. By disabling this you can see several commits being merged from one branch into another, making it easier to roll back that whole series of commits without digging through the history to see where each commit from the branch came from. git config --global merge.ff false remotes Add a remote git remote add upstream https://github.com/danielhoherd/homepass Push to a specific remote # push to the master branch of the remote named upstream git push upstream master Alter the source of origin If you move your repo to another location, use this command to change the upstream URL: git remote set-url origin https://user@newhost/newpath/reponame git reset git reset allows you to reset your state to what it was at a previous point. Reset to a prior state based on what has been done locally The reflog is a log of what steps have been performed locally. You can view the reflog, then reset to a prior state. git reflog # show all HEAD changes git reset --hard 45e0ae5 # reset all git tracked state to 45e0ae5 Alternately, you can use a date: git reflog --date=iso # absolute date based reflog references git reset \"HEAD@{2015-03-25 14:45:30 -0700}\" --hard Reset feature branch to state when it was branched from master Do this if you want to start your branch over with only the current changes. This is useful if you've been iterating through lots of bad changes that were committed and want to clean them all out. It basically lets you squash to a single commit on your branch. git reset $(git merge-base master $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)) Hard reset of local changes This will abandon all local changes and resolve merge conflicts git fetch origin git reset --hard origin/master git clean Remove all untracked files and directories This is useful after your reset to a prior state.

EG: if you have docker installed, you can run the following command to run the build step of your pipeline: gitlab-runner exec docker build The gitlab-runner command has good inline options. Skip CI via git push option git push -o ci.skip Skip CI via commit message https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/yaml/#skipping-jobs #!/usr/bin/env bash # Skip CI if all changed files are inside dir \"foo/\" set -x regex='^foo\\/' files=( $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM ) ) for X in \"${files[@]}\" ; do # If any file is not inside dir foo exit 0 if [[ ! \"$X\" =~ $regex ]] ; then exit 0 fi done # If we've made it here, all changed files are inside dir foo/ # so we append '[no ci]' to commit message to skip CI in Gitlab echo \"[no ci]\" >> \"$1\" Run privileged mode gitlab-runners in GKE This is needed to run docker commands, which is useful for building containers, running ansible molecule, etc.. The runners.tags includes ${ORG_NAME} which is great for making sure jobs run on your own runners instead of publicly shared runners. This is important because DOCKER_HOST is different in Kubernetes than it is on public dind runners. export REGISTRATION_TOKEN=\"foobar\" export ORG_NAME=\"acme\" helm \\ install gitlab/gitlab-runner \\ --tiller-namespace gitlab-managed-apps \\ --name \"gitlab-runner-${ORG_NAME}-$(date +%s)\" \\ --set \"gitlabUrl=https://gitlab.com/\" \\ --set \"runnerRegistrationToken=${REGISTRATION_TOKEN}\" \\ --set \"runners.env.DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=\" \\ --set \"runners.imagePullPolicy=always\" \\ --set \"runners.privileged=true\" \\ --set \"runners.tags=${ORG_NAME}\\,dind\\,gke\" the runners.privileged=true is the magic that is needed to enable docker commands in your .gitlab-ci.yml files to succeed. this --set flag creates the pod environment: spec: containers: env: - name: KUBERNETES_PRIVILEGED value: \"true\" runners.env.DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR= is required to fix the changes with Docker 19.03 outlined in https://about.gitlab.com/2019/07/31/docker-in-docker-with-docker-19-dot-03/ and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/64959 See more variables that you can set by running helm inspect gitlab/gitlab-runner Pros and cons Pros You can create a new repo by locally initializing a git repo, setting a remote_url to where you want your project to be, and pushing your code. The server gives you a notification that the project has been created and gives you a URL to it. Built in docker registry for every project Built in CI with on-prem runners Cons Push-button GKE is configured at the project level, not the group level, so setting up k8s runners is more involved than it could be. User permissions do not have a distinct group entity, they are managed by creating a project sub-group which functions as both a place to put code and a permission level. This shows up in a variety of places, and I suspect is the reason we cannot export groups over SAML.

Variable names _varname - Semi-private. Basically a convention that developers use to indicate that the scope of a variable is local, but this locality is not enforced by the interpreter. __varname - Private variable in name, but not in logic or security. The interpreter mangles the name of the var to make it globally unique, but it is still globally accessible. var_ - Used to get around shadowing built-in variable names. EG: list_ won't conflict with list() __magic_method__ - See https://www.diveinto.org/python3/special-method-names.html _ - Temp var, pretty common entity in programming. (eg: bash and perl both support this too.) Virtual Environments Virtual environments isolate your project away from the system's python interpreter and modules, so you can have full control over what code is available to your project. This makes it easy to develop, debug, and deploy to a new system. It's basically always a good idea to use a virtual environment. You will thank yourself later by learning this one up front. Virtual environments using venv Creating a venv echo \"venv\" >> .gitignore virtualenv venv . venv/bin/activate pip install requests pip freeze > requirements.txt # write code, interact with it, whatever deactivate Recreating a venv virtualenv venv . venv/bin/activate pip install -r requirements.txt # write code, interact with it, whatever deactivate Use venv to work around missing pip This is mostly useful for installing for your user, since if you can't install pip you won't be able to install into system-wide locations. virtualenv venv --system-site-packages && venv/bin/pip install --user \"$PACKAGENAME\" && rm -rf venv Virtual environments with pipenv \"Pipenv \u2014 the officially recommended Python packaging tool from Python.org, free (as in freedom). Pipenv is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. Windows is a first-class citizen, in our world.\" - https://docs.pipenv.org pipenv is the new-school 2017 way of doing virtual environments. pipenv creates a file called Pipfile whenever you install packages using the pipenv command.

For instance, to only transfer mp4 files: rsync -ai --include='*.mp4' --exclude=\"*\" remote-server:/media/movies/ ~/Movies/ If you exclude first, nothing will be transferred. Long and Partial Transfers If you're doing transfers which you'd like to monitor and risk being cut off, use this syntax: rsync -e ssh -az --partial --progress ./foo remotehost:~/bar/ This will resume broken file transfers where they were left off, and give you completion statistics with transfer rate, percent complete and estimated time left.

It should only take a few seconds. Lines with 'hf' indicate a hard linked file.

Examples: P10Y - a duration of ten years. P5DT12H - a duration of five days and twelve hours. P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S - a duration of three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds. P1M - one month. PT1M - one minute. Time intervals A time interval is the intervening time between two time points. There are four ways to express a time interval: Start and end, such as 2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z Start and duration, such as 2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M Duration and end, such as P1Y2M10DT2H30M/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z Duration only, such as P1Y2M10DT2H30M , with additional context information Repeating intervals Repeating intervals are formed by adding R[n]/ to the beginning of an interval expression. Such as R5/2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z . The n can be omitted if the interval should repeat forever. RFC 3339 RFC 3339 is considered a profile of ISO 8601. It defines a profile of ISO 8601 for use in Internet protocols and standards. It explicitly excludes durations and dates before the common era. The more complex formats such as week numbers and ordinal days are not permitted. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339 Leap Seconds \"A leap second is a one-second adjustment that is occasionally applied to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in order to keep its time of day close to the mean solar time, or UT1 .\" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second Leap seconds are scheduled by the international earth rotation and reference systems service (See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Earth_Rotation_and_Reference_Systems_Service ) Leap seconds cause a variety of problems in computer systems, and complicate time tracking in general.
